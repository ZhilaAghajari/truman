34,"For everyone asking how to make soda: The basic recipe is to fill a clean, empty plastic bottle most of the way with water, add the flavored simple syrup of your choice (yes, you must use real sugar!) and a pinch of yeast. Champagne yeast is ideal if you can find it, but regular bread yeast works too. Then screw the cap on and let it sit for 24 hours or so. Taste after that time to make sure it's bubbly. If it is, put it in the fridge so it doesn't explode. Then enjoy!",earthpulse,101,00:10
